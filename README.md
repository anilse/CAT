# CAT
CAT stands for Checklist Automation Tool, it is a software tool which helps testing Android phone. CAT needs a checklist provided as an excel file, parses it and shows it on its GUI. The tool gives its users to change the status of a testcase on its GUI. Whenever user wants the result of the provided checklist, CAT prints an output file. Furthermore, the tool can work parallel with Calaba.sh, which is used to parse testcase and run it on the device-under-test, and gives user a chance to automate any of the testcases.
